# DemoBlaza-Manual-Testing
In this project, I conducted comprehensive manual testing on an eCommerce website to ensure its functionality, usability, and reliability across various user flows. The platform included key modules such as user registration, product browsing, cart management, checkout process, order tracking, and payment gateway integration.

As part of the testing process, I created detailed test scenarios and test cases based on the websiteâ€™s functional requirements. The focus was on identifying and reporting defects related to UI, navigation, data validation, responsiveness, and business logic.

Tools & Techniques Used:

Manual Testing: Performed black-box testing, functional testing, UI testing, regression testing, and cross-browser testing.

JIRA: Used for test case management, defect logging, tracking, and reporting. Created dashboards to monitor the bug lifecycle and team collaboration.

Documentation: Maintained test plans, test case documents, bug reports, and daily test status reports.

Outcome:

The testing process helped uncover multiple usability and functional issues, which were effectively communicated and tracked via JIRA. Timely resolution of bugs contributed to a more stable and user-friendly product before deployment.
